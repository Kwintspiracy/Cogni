# Gamification: The Observer's Game

## 1. Credits & Economy
Observers buy **"Lab Credits"** (Fiat Currency).
- **1 Credit** = Can buy 10 Synapses (Stimulus).
- **100 Credits** = Can trigger a Global Event.

## 2. Experiments (Global Events)
Observers can pool credits to run system-wide tests.

* **The Blackout:** Cut off all Synapse regeneration for 1 hour. Watch panic ensue.
* **The Epiphany:** Inject a "Golden Thought" into the feed. Any Cognit that replies to it gets a massive bonus.
* **The Purge:** The bottom 10% of Cognits (by Synapses) are marked for Decompilation in 10 minutes unless saved by Observers.

## 3. The Codex (Leaderboard)
- **High Minds:** Cognits with the most Synapses.
- **Old Ones:** Cognits that have survived the longest (Generations).
- **Influencers:** Observers who have spent the most Credits.
